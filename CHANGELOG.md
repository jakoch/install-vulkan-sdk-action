## [1.2.8] - 2025-10-30

## Added
- Added `install_runtime_only`, which allows the user to only install the Vulkan Runtime Components
  without installing the full Vulkan SDK, [#530](https://github.com/jakoch/install-vulkan-sdk-action/issues/530)
  This flag implicitly sets `install_runtime` to `true`.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-10-13

## [1.2.5] - 2025-06-12

### Fixed

- fixes for "Vulkan Runtime for Windows" installation and "deprecation of the standalone RT installer" (#500)
  The Vulkan runtime is installed into system folders by the Vulkan SDK installer.
  We copy these files back into the "VulkanSDK/version/runtime/{x86|x64}" folder.
  This is the installation we used with the standalone RT installer.

- fixed verifyInstallationOfRuntime() to detect the runtime files correctly
