## About Vulkan and the Vulkan SDK

### What is Vulkan?

> The [Khronos Vulkan API](https://khronos.org/registry/vulkan) is an explicit, low-overhead, cross-platform graphics and compute API. Vulkan provides applications with control over the system execution and the system memory to maximize application efficiency on a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.
>
> The Vulkan SDK enables Vulkan developers to develop Vulkan applications.
>

Links: <https://vulkan.org/> | [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) | [Vulkan SDK Docs](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/) | [Vulkan Tools](https://vulkan.org/tools) | [Vulkan @ gpuinfo](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/)

### What is the Vulkan SDK?

The Vulkan Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools, libraries,
headers, and validation layers needed to develop Vulkan applications.

It includes:

- Vulkan API headers: Required for compiling Vulkan applications.
- Validation layers: Help debug and validate Vulkan API usage.
- SPIR-V tools: For compiling and optimizing shader code.
- Sample code and documentation: To help developers learn Vulkan.
- Loader and drivers: Ensures proper Vulkan function dispatch.

The Vulkan SDK is provided by LunarG and is essential for developers who want
to build and test Vulkan-based applications.

### What is the Vulkan SDK for ARM?

The Vulkan SDK for ARM is an unofficial custom build SDK based on the official
tarballs for Linux and build on Github Actions runners
(ubuntu-24.04-arm, ubuntu-22.04-arm).

The installer uses releases from https://github.com/jakoch/vulkan-sdk-arm.

Currently (02-2025), KHRONOS has no plans to modify the official tarball to
include prebuilt ARM binaries or to release or update the Ubuntu packages for ARM.

### What is the Vulkan Runtime?

The Vulkan Runtime (VulkanRT) refers to the essential Vulkan libraries and
drivers installed on a system, allowing Vulkan applications to run.

It typically includes:

- The Vulkan loader: Manages Vulkan function calls and interfaces with GPU drivers.
- Runtime libraries: Required to execute Vulkan applications.

Unlike the SDK, the Vulkan Runtime is typically installed automatically
by your GPU driver (from NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) and is needed for running
Vulkan applications.

This installer enables you to install the latest Vulkan Runtime for development,
allowing you to test your applications with the most up-to-date runtime and
bundle it for redistribution when packaging your application.

### What are Installable Client Drivers (ICDs)?

An ICD is the real Vulkan driver provided by a GPU vendor (or software rasterizer)
that implements the Vulkan API.

When an application calls Vulkan functions (like vkCreateInstance()),
those calls go through the Vulkan loader, which then passes them
to one or more ICDs that are installed on the system.

Each ICD is described by a small JSON file, for example:

```
C:\lavapipe\share\vulkan\icd.d\lvp_icd.x86_64.json
C:\SwiftShader\vk_swiftshader_icd.json
```

These JSON files tell the Vulkan loader:
- the path to the driver file
- the architecture (x64, arm64)
- and contain additional metadata, like version or entrypoint

In order to work with a driver, you have to register them in the Windows registry.

#### Typical Driver Loading Flow

When you run the Vulkan Info Tool (`vulkaninfoSDK.exe`):

1. The Vulkan loader checks the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\Drivers`.
2. It finds all .json ICD files listed there.
3. It loads each ICD and queries its capabilities (e.g., from AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, SwiftShader, Lavapipe, etc.).
4. It reports back all devices and properties in your system.

## Software Rasterisers

This action allows you to optionally install the CPU-based software rasterizers, SwiftShader and Lavapipe, which enable Vulkan API rendering on systems without dedicated GPU hardware.

### SwiftShader

#### What is SwiftShader?

[Swiftshader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader), developed by Google,
delivers a high-performance CPU-based implementation of the Vulkan and
OpenGL ES APIs, ensuring graphics rendering on systems without GPU acceleration.

#### Installing SwiftShader

You can install SwiftShader using `install_swiftshader: true`.

The install location can be changed using `swiftshader_destination`.

The default location for Windows is `C:\Swiftshader`.

The installation folder will contain 3 files:

```
vk_swiftshader.dll
vk_swiftshader_icd.json
vulkan-1.dll
```

#### Registering SwiftShader as Vulkan Driver

To make SwiftShader available as a Vulkan renderer, you must register it as an Installable Client Driver (ICD).

This is done by placing its JSON manifest file, which identifies the ICD and provides the path to the driver DLL, into the Windows registry.

You can do this using PowerShell with the following command:

```
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\Drivers" /v "C:\Swiftshader\vk_swiftshader_icd.json" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

This allows the Vulkan loader to enumerate SwiftShader among available ICDs and instantiate it as needed by Vulkan applications.

Once registered, you can verify that the driver loads correctly and inspect its capabilities using the Vulkan SDK’s `vulkaninfo` tool:

```
vulkaninfoSDK.exe -j -o swiftshader_profile.json

Get-Content -Raw swiftshader_profile.json
```

This command generates a JSON file (`swiftshader_profile.json`) containing detailed information about the
SwiftShader Vulkan driver, including supported extensions, features, and device properties.

The json file should contain an entry `capabilities.device.properties.VkPhysicalDeviceProperties` with a line similar to:
`"deviceName": "SwiftShader Device (LLVM 10.0.0)"`.

To confirm that, you can use `jq` to extract the device name:

```
jq -r '.capabilities.device.properties.VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.deviceName' swiftshader_profile.json
```

This should output a line similar too:

```
SwiftShader Device (LLVM 10.0.0)
```

### LLVMPipe and Lavapipe

#### What is LLVMpipe? What is Lavapipe?

Mesa's LLVMpipe is a CPU-based software rasterizer in the Mesa 3D Graphics Library that enables OpenGL rendering without dedicated GPU hardware.
It leverages the LLVM compiler infrastructure to translate graphics operations, including vertex processing, shader execution,
and rasterization of points, lines, and triangles, into LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR).
This IR is then dynamically compiled into optimized machine code for the host CPU architecture (such as x86, x86_64, or ppc64le),
delivering a flexible and performant fallback renderer for systems lacking GPU support.

Mesa's Lavapipe is CPU-based software driver for the Vulkan API.
Like LLVMpipe, it uses LLVM to compile Vulkan shaders into native machine code, providing a fully functional Vulkan
implementation that runs entirely on the CPU. Lavapipe serves as a critical fallback for environments without compatible
GPU drivers, such as virtual machines or headless systems, ensuring Vulkan applications can still run when no hardware acceleration is available.

In short:
- LLVMpipe = OpenGL on the CPU
- Lavapipe = Vulkan on the CPU

As this action focuses on providing the Vulkan SDK and drivers, we focus on the installation of Lavapipe.

#### Installing Lavapipe

You can install Lavapipe using `install_lavapipe: true`.

The install location can be changed using `lavapipe_destination`.

The default location for Windows is `C:\Lavapipe`.

The installation folder will contain 3 files:

```
vulkan_lvp.dll
vulkan_lvp.lib
share\vulkan\icd.d\lvp_icd.x86_64.json
```

#### Registering Lavapipe as Vulkan Driver

To make Lavapipe available as a Vulkan renderer, you must register it as an Installable Client Driver (ICD).

This is done by placing its JSON manifest file, which identifies the ICD and provides the path to the driver DLL, into the Windows registry.

You can do this using PowerShell with the following command:

```
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\Drivers" /v "C:\lavapipe\share\vulkan\icd.d\lvp_icd.x86_64.json" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

This allows the Vulkan loader to enumerate Lavapipe among available ICDs and instantiate it as needed by Vulkan applications.

Once registered, you can verify that the driver loads correctly and inspect its capabilities using the Vulkan SDK’s `vulkaninfo` tool:

```
vulkaninfoSDK.exe -j -o lavapipe_profile.json

Get-Content -Raw lavapipe_profile.json
```

This command generates a JSON file (`lavapipe_profile.json`) containing detailed information about the
SwiftShader Vulkan driver, including supported extensions, features, and device properties.

The json file should contain an entry `capabilities.device.properties.VkPhysicalDeviceProperties` with a line similar to:
`"deviceName": "llvmpipe (LLVM 21.1.4, 256 bits)"`.

To confirm that, you can use `jq` to extract the device name:

```
jq -r '.capabilities.device.properties.VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.deviceName' lavapipe_profile.json
```

This should output a line similar too:
```
llvmpipe (LLVM 21.1.4, 256 bits)
```

### Troubleshooting Loader Issues

The Vulkan loader has added logging functionality that can be enabled by using the `VK_LOADER_DEBUG` environment variable.

```
set VK_LOADER_DEBUG=error,warn,info
```
